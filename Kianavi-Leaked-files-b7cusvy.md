In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Kianavi has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. Kianavi's influence extends beyond her online presence. Her rise to prominence has sparked discussions about the changing landscape of online content creation and the complexities of online fandom.
